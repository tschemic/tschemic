### Hi there 👋

I am a molecular biologist by training and I'm passionate about bioinformatics and data analysis. In my projects I mainly use R and a little bit of Python and Bash. The repositories here can be used to analyze next generation sequencing data coming from Illumina short-read sequencing.

Have fun!!!
